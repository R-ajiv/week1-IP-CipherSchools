    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
    <br> 
    And sorry I could not travel both 
    <br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood 
    <br>
    And looked down one as far as I could
    <br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    <br>
    <br>
    Then took the other, as just as fair
    <br>
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    <br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    <br>
    Though as for that, the passing there
    <br>
    Had worn them really about the same
    <br>

    <p>
        And both that morning equally lay
        <hr>
        In leaves no step had trodden black.

        'The Starlight Night' was
            one of two poems which Hopkins
            sent to his mother as a birthday present,

        the other poem being 'God's Grandeur'.
              what a birthday present!
